                    Recent BSc. (Hons) graduate in Computer science. I mainly focus on Artificial Intelligence, Android and Software development. I've worked as an Optical assistant in <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.visionexpress.ie">Vision Express</a> for 4 years as I went through my college degree.

                    After I graduated, I was invited into a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fungramkb.com/events/2018/index.html">International Conference on meaning and knowledge representation</a>, to represent my BSc (Hons) reserach, that I've been preparing for a year's time. After the conference, I was given an <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ggrayitb/status/1002586079072014336">award</a> for the best project using IBM technologies. You can see my project <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gelmisb/chatbot-watson-android">here</a>, or you can read about it <a target="_blank" href="http://itbrecursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ITB_RECURSION_2018_WEB.pdf">here</a> as well!

                    <br>

                    That's my brief history! And now, at the very moment I am freelancing and writing projects for Android and Web.
