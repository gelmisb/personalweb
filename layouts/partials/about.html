						So, I'm not going to be very dull and just go on about how I graduated from <a href="https://www.itb.ie/" target="_blank">TUD</a> with a BSc. (Hons) in Computer science or that I'm mainly 
						interested in Artificial Intelligence, Android and Web development. No. I'd rather tell you a story... My Story.

								As you already guessed, my name is <a href="#name" class="page-scroll">Gelmis</a>. I was born in this beautiful country called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania" target="_blank">Lithuania</a> <span id="years"></span> years ago. Since one of my family members have moved to Ireland I used to come to visit them during my school holidays. One summer I stayed &amp; started going to <a href="http://www.coolminecs.ie/" target="_blank">school</a> in Dublin. Since (at the time) my hobbies had two things in common (creating and problem solving) &ndash; as soon as I finished school I delved into college to study Computer Science. I graduated without failing a single subject for 4 years and I was given an oportunity to present my BSc. (Hons) research at <a href="http://www.fungramkb.com/events/2018/index.html" target="_blank">International Conference on meaning and knowledge representation</a>, which I had prepared for a year (okay, this is as far as my ego goes, I swear &#128516). You can see my project <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gelmisb/chatbot-watson-android">here</a>, or you can read about it <a target="_blank" href="http://itbrecursion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ITB_RECURSION_2018_WEB.pdf">here</a> as well!

								Whilst studying, I began looking for a job within my field. And finally found one! First, official job in my field. An intership position as a Full - Stack Android developer for <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/en/" target="_blank">MABS</a>. Where I was crafting a prototype financing application for 3 months. As the intership was coming to an end, I was quite bored, since I was unable to get another job straight away. Between a very rare chance of freelancing and the odd exploration trip it felt quite dull. So, I picked up photography, and mostly got inspired by my <a href="http://www.ebfoto.lt/" target="_blank">godfather</a>.While I'm not expert, I'm trying  and as <a href="https://markmanson.net/" target="_blank">Mark Manson</a> once said &ndash; "Don’t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow". So I guess photography is kind of my side hobby for when I travel or feel creative. You can see some of my attempts <a href="http://instagram.com/gelmis.b" target="_blank">here</a> (I'm in progress of developing a photo portfolio / blog kind of a website). That sums up my story. What about you? <a href="#contact" class="page-scroll">Contact me!</a>
