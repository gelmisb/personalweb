	var str = 'As you already guessed, my name is Gelmis. I was born in this beautiful country called Lithuania 23 years ago. Since one of my family members have moved to Ireland I used to come to visit them during my school holidays. One summer I stayed started going to school in Dublin. Since (at the time) my hobbies had two things in common (creating and problem solving) - as soon as I finished school I delved into college to study Computer Science. I graduated without failing a single subject for 4 years and I was given an oportunity to present my BSc. (Hons) research at International Conference on meaning and knowledge representation, which I had prepared for a year (okay, this is as far as my ego goes, I swear). Whilst studying, I began looking for a job within my field. And finally found one! First, official job in my field. An intership position as a Full - Stack Android developer for MABS. Where I was crafting a prototype financing application for 3 months. As the intership was coming to an end, I was quite bored, since I was unable to get another job straight away. Between a very rare chance of freelancing and the odd exploration trip it felt quite dull. So, I picked up photography, and mostly got inspired by my godfather.While I\'m not expert, I\'m trying  and as Mark Manson once said - "Donâ€™t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow". So I guess photography is kind of my side hobby for when I travel or feel creative. You can see some of my attempts in the links below! (I\'m in progress of developing a photo portfolio / blog kind of a website). That sums up my story. What about you?';
